What do I do when a user reports an issue?
==========================================

 This document is focused on the simple case of an email directed to
 support@leastauthority.com.  An email addressed thus causes a zendesk ticket to
 be opened.

Response Rules (*When* to Respond):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Issue reports are responded to ASAP.
 
   * At the moment this is guaranteeable to be within 24 hours.  The next improvement is to make a device available that signals the arrival of issues 24-7.

  * Relevant progress is reported immediately (day of).

  * In the case of no progress a "heartbeat response" is issued 14 days after last contact.

Responses Have the Following Form (*What* to Respond):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 (1) Acknowledgement of reporter contact.
 (2) Analysis of what the LAE engineer believes to be the reporter's concern.

     That is, the engineer reads the report closely and restates what they believe the issuer is reporting.

 (3) Request for clarification if necessary.

     That is, a request that ***if*** the reporter believes the engineer does not understand, would the reporter please clarify opaque points/details. Of course, the reporter may believe the engineer's understanding is adequate in which case no further action is requested of them.

 (4) Information about where the issue will be indexed.

     That is, the engineer says whether the issue is ``solved``, ``pre-existing``, or ``novel``, and points to the relevant location with a hyperlink.

 (5) Assurance that the issue is being addressed, or has been addressed.
 (6) Assurance that LAE will contact the reporter as soon as there is relevant progress, or sufficient time has passed and a still-alive assurance is deemed necessary.

Tahoe-LAFS Relevant Issues:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Some issues have relevance for both the Tahoe-LAFS_ project and LAE_.  These
 issues must be documented in both endeavors.  If an issue is intially
 reported as a Tahoe-LAFS ticket, then an LAE engineer that monitors
 Tahoe-LAFS tickets (David-Sarah) will create an appropriate email
 referencing the ticket, and send it to support@leastauthority.com.
 Conversely relevant issues first reported to LAE, will be documented as
 tickets on Tahoe-LAFS_, by the monitor of support@leastauthority.com
 (Zancas).
